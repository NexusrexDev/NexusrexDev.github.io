## About the Project
Geoshootria is a fast-paced 2D shoot 'em up influenced by several classics from the genre, while keeping it accessible enough to new players.

## Achievements
- Designed 2 stages with increasing difficulty and a challenging boss at the end of each stage.
- Created a flexible spawner system for easier level pattern creation leveraging Godot's custom resources.
- Created the pixel art assets in Aseprite to mimic a retro style similar to Gameboy games.
- Composed the game's soundtrack using Famitracker to approach an authentic, 8-bit chiptune style.
