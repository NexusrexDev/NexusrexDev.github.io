## About the Project
Bushidash is a fast-paced arcade game where you control a samurai in a zen moment disrupted by aliens teleporting in. The game's main mechanic is dashing, acting both as attacking and movement and encourages players to rack combos up and chain dashes to create a faster playstyle, but mistiming a dash will end up breaking the entire streak!

## Achievements
- Limited the mechanics to a single choice for an arcade-y, yet fun gameplay experience and designed the enemies around it.
- Created the assets in Aseprite for a clear, bold and easily readable artstyle.
- Composed the soundtrack using Famitracker and experimented with the Hirajoshi scale to create a gameplay theme influenced by Asian music.
- Delivered the game in 4 days in a web build.
